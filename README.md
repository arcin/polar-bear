PolarBear
===
A mobile messaging app that lets users break the ice through anonymous chatting at local events. PolarBear knows where the party is: when enough users join a chat, the app intelligently resizes the geographical bounds of the conversation, making it easy for users to find and create chatrooms around their location.

PolarBear was a 5 day project created using Agile methodology.
